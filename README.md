# I (Still!) Fucking Hate Dotfiles

An attempt at a Nix-based scheme for managing my dotfiles that's a little more
flexible than the system in [jkachmar/dotnix](https://github.com/jkachmar/dotnix).

In this case "more flexible" means that there is a clear separation between the
"system-level" configuration (i.e. NixOS & `nix-darwin`) and "user-level"
configuration (i.e. `home-manager`).
